Slide 2: Problem Statement
--------------------------------------------------
Access & Urgency:
Mental health support remains inaccessible, stigmatized, and rarely personalized—especially for women and young adults. Our dashboard data shows that over 81% of women in our user base display depression symptoms, and nearly two-thirds face lifestyle-based risk factors. High-risk scores and persistent low mood are common in our analytics, while traditional therapy is expensive and slow, with weeks-long wait times. These barriers leave most people without timely, effective help, fueling cycles of distress and disengagement.

Current Gaps:
Most mental health apps offer generic solutions that lack evidence-based interventions and real personalization. Our engagement metrics reveal users often abandon these platforms due to a lack of progress or connection. Crisis intervention typically happens too late, after symptoms have escalated. This gap is not just a statistic—it represents real people at risk. Mindhaven aims to close this gap with accessible, AI-powered, and personalized support.
